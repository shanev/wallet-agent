# Integration Testing TODO

## Current Status

✅ **Unit Tests**: Complete with 88 test cases covering:
- Contract resolution (12 tests)
- Token registry (27 tests) 
- Token effects (18 tests)

✅ **Integration Tests**: Complete with 30 test cases covering:
- Parameter validation for all token operations
- Error handling and edge cases
- Wallet connection requirements
- Contract resolution behavior
- Multi-chain support

## Next Steps for Complete Integration Testing

### 1. Deploy Test Contracts to Anvil

**Priority: High**

Currently integration tests validate parameter handling and error cases, but they can't test successful contract interactions because no ERC-20/ERC-721 contracts exist on the Anvil testnet.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for test ERC-20 tokens (USDC, USDT, DAI, WETH, LINK)
- [ ] Create deployment scripts for test ERC-721 NFT contracts
- [ ] Set up Anvil test environment with pre-deployed contracts
- [ ] Update integration tests to use deployed contract addresses
- [ ] Add tests for successful token transfers, approvals, and NFT operations

**Files to create:**
- `test/contracts/TestERC20.sol` - Simple ERC-20 for testing
- `test/contracts/TestERC721.sol` - Simple ERC-721 for testing  
- `test/setup/deploy-anvil-contracts.ts` - Deployment script
- `test/setup/anvil-addresses.ts` - Contract address constants

### 2. Add Wagmi Contract Integration Tests

**Priority: Medium**

Test the system's ability to load and interact with user-defined contracts via Wagmi CLI.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create sample `wagmi.config.ts` for testing
- [ ] Add tests for `load_contracts` functionality
- [ ] Test custom contract operations (not just built-in ERC standards)
- [ ] Verify user contracts take priority over well-known tokens

**Files to create:**
- `test/fixtures/wagmi.config.ts` - Sample Wagmi configuration
- `test/integration/handlers/contracts.test.ts` - Contract loading tests

### 3. End-to-End Transaction Testing

**Priority: Medium**

With deployed contracts, add comprehensive transaction flow testing.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Test complete token transfer flows (balance check → transfer → balance verification)
- [ ] Test token approval workflows  
- [ ] Test NFT transfer and ownership verification
- [ ] Test multi-step operations (approve then transfer)
- [ ] Verify transaction receipts and event logs

### 4. Performance and Load Testing

**Priority: Low**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for token operations
- [ ] Test concurrent operation handling
- [ ] Verify memory usage during batch operations
- [ ] Test with large token amounts and precision edge cases

### 5. Mock Chain Testing Improvements

**Priority: Low**

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Create mock contracts that simulate various error conditions
- [ ] Test gas estimation and transaction simulation
- [ ] Add tests for transaction failure scenarios
- [ ] Test with various chain configurations (different block times, gas limits)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Contract Deployment (1-2 days)
1. Set up Anvil with deployed test contracts
2. Update existing integration tests to use real contracts
3. Add successful operation test cases

### Phase 2: Wagmi Integration (1 day)
1. Add contract loading functionality tests
2. Test user-defined contract interactions

### Phase 3: E2E Flows (1-2 days)
1. Comprehensive transaction flow testing
2. Multi-step operation verification

### Phase 4: Polish (1 day)
1. Performance testing
2. Edge case coverage
3. Documentation updates

## Expected Outcomes

After completing these tasks:

- **100% integration test coverage** for all token operations
- **Real contract interactions** validated on testnet
- **End-to-end workflows** tested and verified
- **Performance benchmarks** established
- **Production-ready** token functionality

## Notes

- All tests should remain fast and deterministic
- Use Anvil for consistency and speed
- Maintain backwards compatibility with existing API
- Consider adding CI/CD integration for automated testing
